# Computer vision project (Rock, Paper, Scissors)

> Teachable machine 

## Milestone 1

- Created a github repository and cloned it to the computer vision folder.

## Milestone 2

- Used the online 'Teachable-Machine' resource to create a model that distinguishes between neutral, rock, paper, and scissors. 
- 2,500 sample images were used for each pose to train the model.
- The model will be used in the project to detect user input and predict to a certain degree of accuracy, whether they chose rock, paper, or scissors. 

## Milestone 3

- Created a new conda environment named 'computer_vision'.
- Installed pip and used it to install the relevant packages needed for the project (opencv-python, tensorflow-macos, ipykernel).
