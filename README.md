# Computer vision project (Rock, Paper, Scissors)

> Teachable machine 

## Milestone 1

- Used the online 'Teachable-Machine' resource to create a model that distinguishes between neutral, rock, paper, and scissors. 
- 2,500 sample images were used for each pose to train the model.
- The model will be used in the project to detect user input and predict to a certain degree of accuracy, whether they chose rock, paper, or scissors.
